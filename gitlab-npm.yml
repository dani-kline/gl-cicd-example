    # This is where configuration would vary if wanting to gate at CI/CD. If you set the snyk test to fail on vulns, the
    # snyk test can be in a stage after jira_tickets_for_new_vulns so that breaking the build doesn't result in the
    # jira issues not being created. If not intending to gate, snyk test || true can be used.
